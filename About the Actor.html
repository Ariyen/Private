                <br><br>
                <ul><li><p><strong>Born:</strong>&nbsp; January 7, 1971 · Modesto, California, USA </p></li>

                <strong>Family:</strong> Personal, doesn't matter and doesn't need to be known.<br>
                <br>The known things is that he was married - it didn't last. He has a biological daughter. That is all that needs to be known.<br>
                <br>Actor will reveal when both are ready - if he's seeing anyone, dating anyone, etc. and feels that he's okay and good with the Media and Social media knowing, without calling things out or assuming of things<br>
                <br>Started his career in Acting in 1995. His origin is the United states. He is a Musician, Stage Actor, Make-up artist (formerly), television actor, film actor, film producer, television producer.<br>
                <br>He is the Founder of Rennervation Foundation. A non-profit charity for underprivileged and foster children.<br>
                <br>Currently, anything posted about his adventures, healing, workouts, etc. will become halted to protect his future and aspects of a private life. The goal will be to focus on the career and charity side and show nothing but love and admiration for the work that he's built his career on. This will continue and should be the prevalence of the outlook of his life towards the public, while keeping the rest private.<br>
